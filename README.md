# Credit-Card-Fraud-Transaction-Detection

## Overview

This project is aimed at developing a robust Credit Card Fraud Detection system using machine learning techniques. Credit card fraud is a pressing issue affecting financial institutions and cardholders worldwide. The objective of this project is to build a model that can accurately identify fraudulent credit card transactions, thereby preventing unauthorized charges and minimizing financial losses.

## Problem Statement

Credit card fraud detection poses a unique challenge due to the highly imbalanced nature of the dataset. The majority of transactions are legitimate, while fraudulent transactions represent only a small fraction. This imbalance makes it difficult for conventional machine learning models to effectively detect fraudulent activities.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains credit card transaction data. It includes various features such as transaction amount, time, and anonymized numerical variables derived from the transaction. The dataset is highly confidential and has undergone extensive preprocessing to ensure privacy.

## Approach

To address the imbalanced dataset issue, we employ the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to create synthetic samples of the minority class. SMOTE helps in balancing the dataset, improving the model's ability to detect fraudulent transactions.

### Key Steps:

1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Handling missing values.
   - Feature scaling and normalization.
   - Encoding categorical features.

2. Model Selection:
   - Exploring different machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

3. Model Evaluation:
   - Assessing model performance using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curve, and AUC.

4. Real-time Monitoring:
   - Implementing a mechanism for real-time monitoring and alerting to integrate the trained model into a production environment for timely fraud detection.
